# Chorasmia â€“ Generic algorithms and data structures

This project is intended to contain generic algorithms and data structures that are useful in many different projects and circumstances.

Currently it contains:

- Array2D: a convenient and efficient 2-dimensional array.
- ArrayView2D: a read-only 2-dimensional view that can be used on any suitable contiguous block 
  of memory.
- MutableArrayView2D: a 2-dimensional view that allows assignment.
